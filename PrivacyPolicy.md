Privacy Policy for FootnoteFormat
Last Updated: December 22, 2025

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how FootnoteFormat handles information when you use the FootnoteFormat Google Docs Add-on (the "Add-on"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent user experience.

2. Information Collection and Use
No Personal Data Collection: The Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including names, email addresses, or account details.

No Document Data Collection: The Add-on only accesses the document currently open in Google Docs to perform its core function: formatting footnotes. None of the content within your documents is ever saved, shared, or transmitted to any external servers. All processing happens locally within the Google Workspace environment.

3. Permissions (OAuth Scopes)
The Add-on requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function. These are:

View and manage documents that this application has been installed in (.../auth/documents.currentonly): This allows the Add-on to read and format the footnotes in the specific document you are currently working on. It cannot access any other files in your Google Drive.

Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars from within Google applications (.../auth/script.container.ui): This allows the Add-on to show the user interface (the sidebar) that you use to trigger the footnote formatting.

4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. There is no background tracking or analytics involved in this Add-on.

5. Data Retention
Because we do not collect any data, we do not store or retain any user data.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
