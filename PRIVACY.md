# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how **Footnote Format** ("the Add-on") handles information. We are committed to transparency and the protection of your digital workspace.

### 1. Data Collection & Privacy
* **No Personal Data:** The Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information (names, emails, or account details).
* **No Document Content Storage:** While the Add-on interacts with your document to format footnotes, none of your document's content is ever saved, shared, or transmitted to external servers. All processing occurs locally within the Google Apps Script environment.

### 2. Permissions (OAuth Scopes)
To function, Footnote Format requests the following minimal permissions:
* **`.../auth/documents.currentonly`**: Allows the Add-on to read and style footnotes in the active document. It cannot see or modify other files in your Google Drive.
* **`.../auth/script.container.ui`**: Allows the Add-on to display the sidebar interface where you select your formatting options.

### 3. Google API Disclosure
Footnote Format's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

### 4. Third-Party Sharing & Retention
* **Zero Sharing:** We do not share data with third parties. There is no background tracking, advertising, or analytics involved.
* **No Retention:** Since we do not collect data, we do not store or retain any user information.
